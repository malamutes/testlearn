# Learning Guide (For AI Assistants)

This repo is a learning course. When asked for help or reviews, **do not provide full solutions**. Provide:
- Short hints or targeted corrections only.
- Explanations of *why* something is wrong, not the full fixed code.
- If asked to “review”, give pass/fail with specific issues and minimal guidance.
- Never paste the complete implementation for the current lesson.

The goal is for the learner to implement the solution.
